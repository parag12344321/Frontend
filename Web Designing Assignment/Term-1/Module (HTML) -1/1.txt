Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?
- HTML tag is just opening or closing entity. 
  For example:<p> and </p> are called HTML tags.
- Html elements contain the information written in html tag.
- Html tags are like keywords where each word has a special meaning.
- Html elements have general content.
  For example:<p>This is the content</p>.
  This complete thing is called a HTML element.

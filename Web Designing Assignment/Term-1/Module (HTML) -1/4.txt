What are HTML Entities?
- HTML Entities Replaced reserved charecters in HTML.
- If < greater than > less than you provide or include in a web page,
  it may be that the browser does not take this understand and consider
  it as a tag, html entities are used. It is exemplified as follows.
- Suppose I want to display in a webpage like this :
  Ex.    <p> p tag is written as <p> <\p> 
  Output in browser : p tag is written as
- So now if we want to get the output like this : p tag is written as <p>
  So using this html entity &(An ampersand) will output as above.
  Ex.    <p> p tag is written as &lt;p&gt;<\p> 
  Output in browser : p tag is written as <p>
- It means &lt -> Entity Name and
           &#60 -> Entity Number
- Other Example belows
  1. <p> & or ampersand is written as &amp;<p>
  Output :& or ampersand is written as &
  2. <p> double quot is written as &quot;<p> 
  Output :double quot is written as "
  3. <p> copyright is written as &copy;<p>
  Output :copyright is written as ©
  4. <p> Registered mark is written as &reg;<p>
  Output :Registered mark is written as ®
  5. This is used to show space in the browser:
     <p> This is space &nbsp in that </p>

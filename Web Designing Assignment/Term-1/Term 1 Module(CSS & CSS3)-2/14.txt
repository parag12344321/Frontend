What is embedded style sheets?
- Suppose there are 20 to 25 paragraphs in one sheet and
  we want to change the text style, size or color of all of them,
  then going inside each paragraph and using an inline sheet will consume
  a lot of time, so we use embedded to save that time.
- For an embedded style sheet, by using the style tag inside the head tag,
  applying a css rule will apply that rule to all for any changes.

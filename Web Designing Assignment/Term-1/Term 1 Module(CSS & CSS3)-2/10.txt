Why should background and color be used as separate properties?
- The background properties in css are as below
(1) background-color
(2) background-image
(3) background-position
(4) background-repeat
(5) background-size
(6) background-clip
(7) background-attachment
- The color property is used to change the text color of a html element.
  In this example "This is my text" would be red.
  The CSS background-color is used to change the background color.
- it means all the background properties are used to change
  the background while only the color property is used to change the color of the text.
